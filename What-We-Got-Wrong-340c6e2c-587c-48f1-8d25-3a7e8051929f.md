# What We Got Wrong

Lessons from the Birth of Microservices at Google

- Origin
    - Sun/Solaris: too expensive
    - Linux on commodity hardware: too unreliable
- Constraints
    - Must DIY
    - Scale horizontally
    - Robust to hardware failures
- Google culture in the early 2000s
    - Intellectually rigorous
    - Bottom-up engineering decision making
    - Aspirational
    - a little overconfident
    - idolised epic infrastructure projects
    - Lead to "accidental microservices"
- Lessons
    1. The only good reason to adopt microservices: you will ship your org chart
        - Minimise human communication across teams, reducing overhead
        - Keep service checklist small
    2. Serverless still runs on servers
        - FaaS: good for embarrassingly parallel/stateless situations
        - The network isn't free
    3. "Independence" is not an Absolute
        - Hippies vs **Ants**: factor out cross-cutting concerns
        - Have a platform team
        - Limit the number of languages and stacks
    4. Beware Giant Dashboards
        - Few graphs, many dimensions with filtering and aggregation
        - Observability means:
            - Detecting critical signals (Alert on SLIs, not root causes)
            - Refining the search space
    5. You can't trace *every*thing (or can you?)
        - the amount of log data is too large, so you have to sample
        - Dapper vs Lightstep

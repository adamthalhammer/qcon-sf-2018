# Service Ownership at Slack

Very narrow definition not taking into account service ownership over **time** :'(

- Incidents
    - All runbooks in centralised git repo (markdown files)
    - Alerts must include link to runbooks
    - Incident lunch
    - "Disasterpiece theater"
- Site Reliability Engineers
    - Devops generalists
    - Emotional Intelligence
    - Monitoring
    - Ambassadors
    - Operational maturity
    - Embedded in dev teams
    - Working to decouple services to reduce cascading failures
- Monitoring

    All alerts go to a specific team

    Host level alerts are useless, get rid of them
